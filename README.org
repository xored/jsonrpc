** What
   Pure Fantom implementation of client and server conforming [[http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification][JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol]]. Two reference implementations are planned to make sure the core is flexible enough:
   - HTTP-based. Server is a [[http://fantom.org/doc/web/WebMod.html][WebMod]], client sends POST requests using [[http://fantom.org/doc/web/WebClient.html][WebClient]].
   - TCP-based. Client connects to socket and sends requests. Server processes them asynchronously and returns results once it is done. 
     
** Why?
   - On a pure Fantom remote end we can expose functionality to [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON-RPC#Implementations][any JSON-RPC client]].
   - We can make a pure Fantom client for [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON-RPC#Implementations][any JSON-RPC server]].
